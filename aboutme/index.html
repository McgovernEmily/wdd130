    <h2>Emily McGovern</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone! I am currently wanting to pursue a career in computer science, and this is my
        second semester. I originally wanted to pursue a career in music, but found out that computers are more my
        style.</p>
    <p> Some of my hobbies include playing the
        piano, violin, and guitar. I also love to read, play video games, watch movies, and traveling. Some of
        my favorite places I have visited have been Italy, France, Germany, Hawaii, and Slovenia. I have always wanted
        to go to Iceland, Norway, United Kingdom, and Egypt. Hopefully I'll be able to travel there a some point.</p>
    <p> I do not have a ton of experience in coding, but I am so excited to learn and try new things.</p>
