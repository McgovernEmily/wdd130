        <p>
            People are going to come to this website to find homemade jewelry and be able to find things that are their
            style. The other page will be pictures of some of the jewelry that we will be selling. Each picture will be
            given its own space, with a wonderful explanation about what is on this piece of jewelry. It will also show
            the price of what the producer wants the customer to pay for the piece of jewelry. I would like to try and
            add a link to each picture, to take them to another page to show a bigger picture. It will not just show the
            explanation of the piece and how much it will cost, but there will be buttons that will give the customers
            that opportunity to buy the piece of jewelry. These customers will not just come to this page for the
            beautiful homemade jewelry, but to find that the simplicity of navigating and shopping will be worth the
            experience.
